Working through [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests).

### Takeaways
Use `go vet` to check code

Use channels when passing ownership of data
Use mutexes for managing state
https://go.dev/wiki/MutexOrChannel

Don't embed mutexes in structs
Maybe don't use embedding in structs at all
